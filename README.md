# Sandpit Demo (with es5)
An example of using Sandpit with ES5, in case you'd prefer to avoid ES6.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies and fire it up:

```
git clone https://github.com/sandpit/sandpit-es5.git
cd sandpit-es5
npm install
```

Have a delicious soda. You're doing great. Then:

```
npm start
```

It'll likely be at port `8080` (<http://localhost:8080>), and it's powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).
